## GUIDANCE(FOR USERS & READERS OF THIS REPOSITORY AND ITS CONTENTS)

This folder contains the solutions to all the questions asked in 
assignment 2, of the DBIT 'Introduction To Programming'(EVENING) Class,
as provided by Mr. Barasa.

You will find:
1. Source files for each of the 10 questions, 
2. The output binary files for the source files(termed as ``./a.out``)
2. The output text files(defined by ``.txt``) of source files that do not prompt for user input,
3. And for some source files you have their corresponding text 'test input' files which you can use to test various user inputs and see the program's output for each of them.


To run any C++ source file in this repository:
- Execute ``./run_filename.sh`` in your command line interface to run your program.
*When you type``./run_filename.sh`` it:
1) Calls the g++ compiler, 
2) The g++ compiler generates a binary file(``./a.out``) for the source file
3) And finally, still in the same file, the binary file is called, and the program runs!

**Make sure that you make the ``run_filename.sh`` executable, by changing the permissions**
In Linux, you make it executable by running this command: ``chmod +x run_filename.sh``

**NOTE: Question 1's source file, and text input files are directly under the /assignments/ folder, there is no separate folder for it.**
