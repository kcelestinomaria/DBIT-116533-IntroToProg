## GUIDANCE(FOR USERS & READERS OF THIS REPOSITORY AND ITS CONTENTS)

This folder contains the solutions to all the questions asked in 
assignment 2, of the DBIT 'Introduction To Programming'(EVENING) Class,
as provided by Mr. Barasa.

You will find:
1. Source files for each of the 10 questions, 
2. The output binary files for the source files(termed as ``./a.out``)
2. The output text files of source files that do not prompt for user input,
3. And for some source files their corresponding text 'test input' files which you can use to test various user inputs and see the program's output for each of them.


To run any C++ source file:
- Execute ``g++ filename.cpp`` in your command line interface, to compile the program.
- You will see ``a.out`` binary file generated in your folder.
- You can finally run ``./a.out`` if you want to run the program.

**NOTE: Question 1's source file, and text input files are directly under the /assignment/ folder, there is no separate folder for it.**
